bird-watching
=============

second iphone app

This app allows the user to create a list of
birds that he or she has sighting in their life.

The app has a main page which displays the list
of all the birds that he or she has recorded.  Each 
sighting contains the name of the bird and the date
that the bird was seen.  

If the sighting is selected, then a screen will open up
showing more detail (namely the location) of the bird sighting.

The user can also select an add button to add a bird sighting. 

The user will be prompted to enter the name of the bird and the 
location of the sighting. Once pressing done, the sighting
will be added to the list of all sightings.

Currently there is no ability to delete a sighting from the 
list.


One concept I learned about was segues, particularly unwind 
segues.  These tell the application what to do when a screen
is exited in various different manners. This will be very useful 
going forward.
